\begin{proof}
	Since $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space, say $\dim(V) = n$. If $W = \{0\}$, then $W$ is a finite-dimensional and $\dim(W) = 0 \leq n$. Otherwise, $W$ contains a nonzero vector $x_1$ ; so $\{x_1\}$ is linearly independent set. Continue choosing vectors, $x_1,\cdots,x_k $ in $W$ such that $S = \{x_1,\cdots,x_k\}$ is linearly independent. Since no linearly independent subset can contain more than $n$ vectors in $V$, therefore $S \cup \{v\}$ is linearly dependent for $\{v\}\in span(S)$ then by Thm 1.7 $S$ generates $W$. $S$ is a basis of $W \implies \dim(W) = k \leq n$. If $\dim(W) = n$, then a basis for $W$ is a linearly independent subset of $V$ containing $n$ vectors. By replacement theorem any linearly independent subset of $V$ contains exactly $n$ vectors is also a basis of $V$. Hence $V = W$.
